          I have strong front-end development skills, with proficiency in
          technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Firebase. My
          problem-solving capabilities enable me to tackle challenges
          effectively, whether optimizing code, debugging issues, or improving
          user interfaces. I excel at creating responsive and dynamic web
          applications that enhance user experience. Additionally, I have a
          solid understanding of the principles of UI/UX design, which allows me
          to build intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. My ability to
          adapt quickly to new tools and frameworks ensures that I stay current
          with industry trends and best practices.

        <h4>What is your weaknesses?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          While I have strong front-end development skills, there are areas
          where I can improve. For instance, I am still working on mastering
          certain advanced features of React and Firebase, which can
          occasionally slow down my development process. Additionally, my focus
          on front-end technologies means I have less experience with back-end
          development, which limits my ability to work on full-stack projects
          independently. I am also continuously improving my time management
          skills to balance coding tasks with project deadlines more
          effectively. Addressing these weaknesses will help me become a more
          well-rounded developer.

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science
          and Engineering (CSE), which has provided me with a strong foundation
          in software development, algorithms, and computer systems. My
          education has equipped me with both theoretical knowledge and
          practical skills, particularly in front-end development using
          technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Firebase. During
          my studies, I engaged in various projects and assignments that honed
          my coding and problem-solving abilities. This qualification has given
          me a solid understanding of the software development lifecycle and the
          technical expertise needed to excel in front-end development roles.
